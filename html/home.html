  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p class="override">My name is Anthony Ponomarenko. This site serves as a personal portfolio and also to develop my skills in Web Development. It has been built with HTML5, CSS3(SASS), JavaScript, JQuery and Bootsrap to be responsive and look great on all devices.</p>

  <p>It is constantly evolving to incorporate what I am currently researching and also serves as a reminder to myself of what I have achieved in my career.</p>

  <p>You may have noticed the greyscaleness of this site. I am in fact colourblind, I have Deuteranopia. I get the same questions whenever someone finds out so to circumvent this I provide the following link <a target="_blank" href="http://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/colour-blindness-experience-it/">to see what I see.</a></p>

    <h2>A little about me</h2>
    <p> For the past 8 years I have been a Flash Developer, however I have been working with Flash for over 15 years. I class myself as being a Flash Developer when I started using AS3 and OOP to create projects.</p>

    <h3>In the beginning...</h3>
    <p>It all started at High School when in my graphics class we started learning CAD. I never really used a computer prior to this in any other way apart from writing reports and playing Doom. I enjoyed it thoroughly, being able to create something technical on a computer. This led me to start studying Engineering once I completed grade 12.</p>
    <p>After a year of engineering I decided it wasnt for me. I enjoyed the computer and practical subjects however the rest didnt capture me as I thought it would. I dropped out and looked for something more creative.</p>

    <h3>The introduction to computer generated creativity</h3>
    <p>I had always had a creative streak and always loved computers and technology. These two areas of my persona were allowed to run free when I started the Certificate in Digital Art. I didnt consider it study, I considered it play. We would use Flash and Photoshop to create Art. It was so satisfying to see something being created in a new media that was just starting to find its feet and being able to show my works not only in print but also on computer. </p>

    <p>After a year of play I continued into the newly created Diploma of Multimedia. Here we used Flash, Photoshop, Premier, Director, Maya and a slew of other programs not to art, but to create viable products that could be used by others. Our final project was for the Brisbane City Council, A guide to Brisbane Skateparks on CD-ROM that is still available to this day in state run libraries. The Guide contained an interactive map of the locations of the Skateparks with Quicktime VR and 3D renders of the skateparks along with video </p>

    <h3>Traineeship</h3>
    <p>After completing my Diploma I was urged to apply for a Multimedia Developer traineeship at the very TAFE where I was taught. I was offered the positon and promply resigned from my prestigeous employment as a Deli hand at Woolworths.</p>
    <p> The new position was in a small team of 3, two developers and our manager. We created learning resources for courses offered at TAFE, however as they had extremely rich content and dial-up internet was the only internet, they were all delivered on CD-ROM. </p>
    <p>At the end of the traineeship I was hopeful to continue my role, but the campus was several million dollars in the red, jobs had to be shed. Our entire team was made obsolite. I began to look for work elsewhere.
